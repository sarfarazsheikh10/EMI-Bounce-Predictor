## About
- Built a machine learning model to predict which clients are most likely to default on their EMI payments for tractor loans. 
- Preprocessed data, performed EDA, trained and tested various ML models and deployed a web application based on the model on Heroku.
- This project was submitted for TVS Credit E.P.I.C. Analytics Challenge Season 4 (2022).
